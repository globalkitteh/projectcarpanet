        <p>Welcome to the future of the internet.</p>
        <p>I'm building a new internet for my friends with the intent of escaping the dark forest the public internet has become, making a collaborative homelab ecosystem, and applying our networking skills.</p>
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            Carpanet uses Zerotier to form an SD-WAN connecting multiple homelabs together, with each using a firewall to route and segment connections between disparate networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            carpanet will include a centralized DNS system forwarded to each component system (estuary), as well as user management via LDAP, and will self-document using phpIPAM and a wiki or knowledge management system.
